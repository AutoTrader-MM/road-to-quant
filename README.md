# road-to-quant

Study resources to become a quant researcher. 
# Phase 1: build your foundations
Learn math, programming and finance well during this phase. Build a solid knowledge and skills foundation.

  ## Math
  
  1 Combinatorics, probability and statistics
    
   - [ ] Casella and Bergers
   - [ ] Introduction to Probability, by Blitzstein & Hwang
   - [ ] OpenIntro Statistics, 4th ed, by Diez

  2 Linear algebra
  
  - [ ]  Introduction to Linear Algebra, Fifth Edition by Gilbert Strang
    
  3 Optimization

  4 Stochastic process and calculus
  
  - [ ] Shreve volume 1 and 2

## Programming

  1 Python
  
    * UCB CS61 A B C, not sure if no EDX but there is a lot online resources
    * Harward CS50 on EDX
    * Rice Fundamentals of Computing Specialization on coursera
    * Python cookbook textbook
  
  2 Data structure and algorithm
  
  - [ ] Coursera course from Princeton: Algorithms, part 1 and 2
  
  3 Machine learning and AI
  
    * https://mlcourse.ai/book/index.html, Elements of statistical learning
    *Foundations of Reinforcement Learning with Applications in Finance, Ashwin Rao, he has a whole course website with assignments and exams
    * ESL book with the reading group + EDX course from the authors
  
  4 Mining of Massive Datasets
  
  * http://www.mmds.org, see also the EDX course and free pdf textbook
  
  5 C++
  * Udemy nanodegree
  * accelerate C++
  * Primer
  * Coursera course

## Finance
* Vault guide 
* McDonald 
* financial derivatives book

## Brain teaser: all the interview books

## At least one competition plus a few interesting projects
    * IMC trading competition

# Phase 2: build your portfolio (website, linkedin, resume)
Write projects and collect them

# Phase 3: network, applications and interviews
review those inteview problems over and over, 3 times at least for the important ones
